# ISSUES
**Append-only section-based log**

Entries record newly discovered requests or changes, with their outcomes. No instructive content lives here. Read @NOTES.md for the process to follow when fixing issues.

Read @AGENTS.md, @AGENTS.DOCKER.md, @AGENTS.FRONTEND.md, @AGENTS.GIT.md, @POLICY.md, @NOTES.md, @README.md and @ISSUES.md. Start working on open issues. Work autonomously and stack up PRs.

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [<ID>-<number>]`. When resolved it becomes -` [x] [<ID>-<number>]`

## Features (100-199)

## Improvements (200–299)

## BugFixes (300–399)

## Maintenance (400–499)

- [ ] [MP-400] Prepare a docker compose orchestration using ghttp @tools/ghttp/README.md. Use a docker image from ghcr.

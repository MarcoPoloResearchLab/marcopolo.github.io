## Features (100-199)

- [ ] [MP-100] Prepare a replacement for the hero part of the page, where we draw marco Polo Research Lab portrait and title. Replace it with web-optimized video of @assets/A_cyberpunk_engraving_202509270000.mp4. disable sound by default but allow a control to enable the sound. Use @assets/Generated Image September 25, 2025 - 4_19PM.jpeg for favicon (prepare it as a favicon and include it in the html itself, same as it's done now). Check @tools/tyemirov/svg_tools/README.md for a set of tools to help with favicon and other image operations as needed.

## Improvements (200–299)

## BugFixes (300–399)

## Maintenance (400–499)
